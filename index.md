#### Why would you be a good fit for the Customer Success Specialist role?

I've worked remotely doing customer-based email support for a year and a half now, prior to which I was the IT department (of one) in the Melbourne offices of a company running multiple nightclubs (a role which including dabbling in marketing, web development, Photoshop, and pretty much anything else going). I love being able to give folks the information they need, when they need it ‚Äì or to go and find it out in those cases where I can't, and to write it down so I can next time! üòÅ

Besides, if you hire me I'll tell you the eight issues I spotted with the copy on the Raisely homepage ([though I gather these may all be swept away in the forthcoming relaunch‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/MrDavidFTurner/status/1090397385400799234))

#### Why do you want to work here over somewhere else?

I'm skeptical of early startups as a rule (I'm always interested in where the money comes from), but I love the 'everybody wins' model that Raisely operates under ‚Äì¬†the charity partners get as much of their pledge money as possible, and Raisely adds a little on top which (crucially) pledgers can opt out of if they wish. It seems a fair deal for all involved, and a good model for growth. Working for a non-profit that in turn helps organisations helping others seems like a worthy way to spend one's working day!

#### Look at [this list of tasks](https://gist.github.com/tommaitland/193b189f80d15309f4bfc475a3a7e81e) and tell us which two you are excited by, which two you want to learn and the two you don‚Äôt want to do.

'Updating the developer docs to cover a new release' and 'Work with developers to debug and resolve a product issue' are among the most exciting on the list ‚ÄìI'm a big one for documentation (both internal and external) as a means to capturing and sharing company knowledge, and my technical bent means I'm always keen to dig deep to find and fix even the edgiest of edge cases.

Kepla CRM is totally new to me, so 'Importing data into a new Kepla account' would be something I'd like to learn, as is 'Recruit a new team member' ‚Äì I was informally involved in helping new folks find their feet in my previous role at 1Password and found this immensely rewarding, so I'd love to be involved throughout the whole hiring and on boarding process.

I'm least taken by 'Create a video tutorial on how to set up a campaign' (I generally prefer to read rather than watch to get information, so wouldn't be the best person for this task) and 'Change the fonts and background colour on someone's campaign' (not to say that wouldn't or couldn't ‚Äì just a little less exciting to me than the rest of the list).

#### Tell us about a company who does customer support well, and why you think they‚Äôre good.

I've never failed to be impressed by Slack support ‚Äì¬†help is always right where you need it (never more than a /feedback away), responses have always been timely (often within minutes!), and without exception every interaction has been a warm and friendly one.
